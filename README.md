# AdvancedCustomDataFiltering
 I created this small app to showcase a template I created for highly advanced custom data filtering. The goal of this project was to create a way for users to be able to endlessly filter data in a data table with as many where clauses as they want.

 the "/list" page showcases this workflow. Each column can be dynamically shown/hidden and the user can add as many where clauses as they would like via the column filter button.
